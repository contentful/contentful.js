    <strong>What is Contentful?</strong>
  </summary>
  <p>
      <a href="https://www.contentful.com/">Contentful</a>
      provides a content infrastructure for digital teams to power content in websites, apps, and devices. Unlike a CMS, Contentful was built to integrate with the modern software stack. It offers a central hub for structured content, powerful management and delivery APIs, and a customizable web app that enable developers and content creators to ship digital products faster.
  </p>
</details>

## üöÄ‚ÄàCore Features

- Content retrieval through Contentful's [Content Delivery API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/).
- [Synchronization](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/concepts/sync/)
- [Localization support](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/concepts/locales/)
- [Link resolution](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/concepts/links/)
- Built in rate limiting with recovery procedures
- ES6 modules / bundler support (**since v5.0.1 - 17. Oktober 2017**)
- Supports [Environments](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/concepts/multiple-environments/) (**since v6.0.0 - 06. April 2018**)

### Supported browsers and Node.js versions:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge
- IE11 (with [legacy version](#legacy-browsers) of the library)
- Safari
- node.js (6.x, 8.x)

Other browsers should also work, but at the moment we're only running automated tests on the browsers and Node.js versions specified above.

## üõ´‚ÄàGetting started

In order to get started with the Contentful JS SDK you'll need not only to install it, but also to get credentials which will allow you to have access to your content in Contentful.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Your first request](#your-first-request)
- [Using this SDK with the Preview API](#using-this-sdk-with-the-preview-api)
- [Authentication](#authentication)
- [Documentation & References](#documentationreferences)

### ‚òÅÔ∏è‚ÄàInstallation

```sh
npm install contentful
```

#### Using it directly in the browser:

For browsers, we recommend to download the SDK via npm or yarn to ensure 100% availability.

If you'd like to use a standalone built file you can use the following script tag or download it from [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/contentful), under the `dist` directory:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/contentful@latest/dist/contentful.browser.min.js"></script>
```

Using `contentful@latest` will always get you the latest version, but you can also specify a specific version number.

<details>

</summary>

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/contentful@5.0.1/dist/contentful.browser.min.js"></script>
```

The Contentful Delivery SDK will be accessible via the `contentful` global variable.

Check the [releases](https://github.com/contentful/contentful.js/releases) page to know which versions are available.

</details>

#### üèö‚ÄàLegacy browsers:

This library also comes with a legacy version to support Internet Explorer 11 and other older browsers. It already contains a polyfill for Promises.

To support legacy browsers in your application, use `contentful.legacy.min.js` instead of `contentful.browser.min.js`

## üê£‚ÄàYour first request

The following code snippet is the most basic one you can use to get some content from Contentful with this SDK:

```js
const contentful = require("contentful");
const client = contentful.createClient({
  // This is the space ID. A space is like a project folder in Contentful terms
  space: "developer_bookshelf",
  // This is the access token for this space. Normally you get both ID and the token in the Contentful web app
  accessToken: "0b7f6x59a0"
});
// This API call will request an entry with the specified ID from the space defined at the top, using a space-specific access token.
client
  .getEntry("5PeGS2SoZGSa4GuiQsigQu")
  .then(entry => console.log(entry))
  .catch(err => console.log(err));
```

You can try and change the above example at [Tonic](https://tonicdev.com/npm/contentful), or if you'd prefer a more Browser oriented example, check out this [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/contentful/kefaj4s8/) version of our Product Catalogue demo app.

## Using this SDK with the Preview API

This SDK can also be used with the Preview API. In order to do so, you need to use the Preview API Access token, available on the same page where you get the Delivery API token, and specify the host of the preview API, such as:

```js
const contentful = require("contentful");
const client = contentful.createClient({
  space: "developer_bookshelf",
  accessToken: "preview_0b7f6x59a0",
  host: "preview.contentful.com"
});
```

You can find all available methods of our client in our [reference documentation](https://contentful.github.io/contentful.js)

### üîë‚ÄàAuthentication

To get your own content from Contentful, an app should authenticate with an OAuth bearer token.

You can create API keys using [Contentful's web interface](https://app.contentful.com). Go to the app, open the space that you want to access (top left corner lists all the spaces), and navigate to the APIs area. Open the API Keys section and create your first token. Done.

Don't forget to also get your Space ID.

For more information, check the Contentful's REST API reference on [Authentication](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/authentication/).

## Troubleshooting

- **Can I use the SDK in react native projects** - Yes it is possible
- **I get the error: Unable to resolve module `http`** - Our SDK is supplied as node and browser version. Most non-node environments, like React Native, act like a browser. To force using of the browser version, you can require it via: `const { createClient } = require('contentful/dist/contentful.browser.min.js')`

- **Link resolution does not work when using `client.getEntry('<entry-id>')`** - Link resolution does not work with the single entity endpoint, you can use `client.getEntries({'sys.id': '<entry-id>'})` to link an entry with resolved links
- **Can I use it with typescript?** - Yes, there is also a type definition file
- **Is the SDK doing any caching?** - No, check this [issue](https://github.com/contentful/contentful.js/issues/83) for more infos
- üò± **Something is wrong what should I do?** - If it is a bug related to the code create a Github issue and make sure to remove any credential for your code before sharing it. - If you need to share your credentials, for example you have an issue with your space, please create a support ticket in the [support page](parameters).


The [Contentful's JS SDK reference](https://contentful.github.io/contentful.js) documents what objects and methods are exposed by this library, what arguments they expect and what kind of data is returned.

Most methods also have examples which show you how to use them.

You can start by looking at the top level [`contentful`](./contentful.html) namespace.

    From version 3.0.0 onwards, you can access documentation for a specific version by visiting `https://contentful.github.io/contentful.js/contentful/<VERSION>`
